# Knowledge Distillation Configuration
# This configuration uses knowledge distillation to train on a second task
# while maintaining performance on the first task

# Teacher model (trained on the first task)
teacher: logs/preliminary/final_model.pth

# Student model initialization (starts from the teacher)
load: logs/preliminary/final_model.pth

# Knowledge distillation weight (λ_distill)
# Controls the influence of teacher predictions via KL divergence
distillation: 0.1

# Training parameters
batch_size: 32
lr: 0.001
max_epochs: 10
val_check_interval: 0.2  # Validate every 20% of an epoch

# Data size (use subset for faster experiments)
size: 10000

# Early stopping configuration
early_stop: true
patience: 3

# Experiment settings
experiment: distillation
seed: 42

# Note: EWC is disabled (ewc: 0.0) - only distillation is used
